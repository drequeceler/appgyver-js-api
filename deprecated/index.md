# appgyver.js deprecated APIs

The following API namespaces contain methods that are deprecated, most of them because Cordova offers the same functionality. The methods still function (for the most part), but [Cordova's APIs](http://docs.phonegap.com) provide our recommended way for communicating with your mobile device. We provide no support for deprecated APIs.

Some API namespaces listed below (such as AG.file and AG.GUI) also contain non-deprecated methods; these methods are not listed here. See the [front page](../index.md) for a list of currently active and supported APIs.
