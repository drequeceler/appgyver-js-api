# AG.events.addEventListener

## Summary
`addEventListener()` adds an event listener to the current view that listens for the specified event. The available events and their functions are slightly different between normal mode and Edge mode:

**Normal mode events:**

* **focus**<br>
 Happens when the current tab bar view gains focus (after switching to another tab).
* **topDoubleTapped**<br>
 Happens when the user double-taps the navigation bar.

**Edge mode events:**

* **focus**<br>
 Happens when the current view gains focus (after returning from another view or after going to home screen and back).
* **lostFocus** / **unfocus**<br>
 Happens when navigation bar back navigation button is tapped. The two event names perform identical events.

The success callback function of the event listener is fired every time the listened event happens.

## Quick example:
```javascript
AG.events.addEventListener("topDoubleTapped", function(){
  AG.GUI.alert("Success", "Top bar was double tapped!");
});
```

## Syntax
```javascript
AG.events.addEventListener(event, successCallback)
```

* *string* **event**<br>
  The event that the event listener listens to. Possible values are:
    * `"focus"`

    See above for more details on when the different events are triggered.
    
* *function* **successCallback**<br>
  The success callback function.
