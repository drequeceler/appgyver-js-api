# ~~AG.navigation~~ (deprecated methods)

*These APIs are deprecated and available in Legacy mode only.*

The **AG.navigation** namespace contains methods that allow you to control view-specific navigation history and page transition animations.

Use cases for the methods in the navigation namespace are rare, because appgyver.js automatically takes care of the page transitions and the history logic.

In Legacy mode, AppGyver doesn't render new pages as separate layers, but rather functions more like a regular browser (the previous page is not kept active but is reloaded after the native back button is pressed).
