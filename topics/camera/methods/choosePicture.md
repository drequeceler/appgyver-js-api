# AG.camera.choosePicture

## Summary
`choosePicture()` shows the user a native dialogue for selecting an image source: taking a new picture with the camera or choosing one from the device's photo library.

The success callback function gets triggered when the user successfully selects an image (either a new one or an existing one). The failure callback function gets triggered if 

* taking the picture fails, 
* retrieving the picture from the native photo library fails, or 
* the user cancels the native dialogue. 

If the device does not have a camera, the method will try to open the device's photo library instead, bypassing the dialogue for selecting an image source.

## Quick example:
```javascript
camera.choosePicture({filename: "myFile.jpg"}, successCallback(data), failureCallback);
```

## Syntax
```javascript
camera.choosePicture(options, successCallback(data), failureCallback);
```
