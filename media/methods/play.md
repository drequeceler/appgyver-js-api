## Summary
`play()` plays an audio file from the app's file system. Supported formats include .aiff, .mp3 and .wav.

Note that playing .mp3 files has a slight delay compared to .wav files due to the decoding process.

*There is currently a known issue where playing a nonexistent audio file crashes the app.*

AG.media.play("audio/myaudio.wav");
```

```javascript
AG.media.play(filename)
```
